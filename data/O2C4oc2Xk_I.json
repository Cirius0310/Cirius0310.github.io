{"cid": "UgzUw0GbgT_sif69dyh4AaABAg", "text": "The best phrase to describe this game is It's the easiest and hardest Fromsoft game. Easiest if you explore and hardest if you stubbornly and stupidly keep hitting your head on a wall. Even the most veteran and professional players in the field are spending 20-40 hours before deciding to fight Margit or progressing in the main story, yet I see all these new players including holomems that just beeline straight to stormveill and fighting to boss that's clearly way above their level in the first couple hours of the game untill thry either quit the game or spend hours on that singular boss! And every time I look at chat, it's always \"roll better\" or \"this weapon is better\" or \"good luck\" instead of giving even the tiniest hint of like \"are you sure you're supposed to be here right now\" or something, how about actual helpful tips like \"heavy roll is worse that having no armor on\" or \"100% resist shield instead of powerstancing might help with not dying and beating the boss by a lot\" like anything like that and it's so frustrating because the alternative is always \"the streamer is not having fun with this game and quit because it's too hard\", except it's not, it's the easiest Fromsoft game, but everyone is always making it harder on themselves which is just obnoxiously frustrating, but hey if they don't want backseating then sure fine, have a bad day with the game, I mean it's a game you bought and it's your own enjoyment you're sacrificing.

Elden ring enemies know when you have a shield or staff in your hand, They also can read button inputs. Enemies usually react to you.

I still think most of that hinges heavily upon relying upon guides to work, otherwise a new player might linger too long on inconsequential encounters and just abandon anything too difficult and not make any meaningful progression.\nAsylum Demon has very long wind ups to their attacks, barely any multi hit combos and a pretty small health pool. Not to mention you get to knock off a chunk of its HP in the fall attack and have the option of black fire bombs if you really get stuck. I can see why people could stop at Asylum Demon, but the game is very generous and even though asylum demon is big, gameplay wise it's not too different from the hollows in the prison, it's a natural escalation in difficulty. In contrast, nothing in Limgrave prepares you for any of the boss battles in that region, no matter how much time you spend practicing on foot soldiers, none of them naturally lead into the challenge posed by Margit, The tomb Gargoyle, the cave beast, erdtree avatars or the Leonid at Morne.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "@LizardVVizard", "channel": "UCvhiEsUahmsP8T79BlhBkXg", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/SZPmScnviwbW-W9R7g7amju-072yZBf3Yy_nxHaRO2PzkiGdJFgfumQFtxBEGjQRtAuGi6bQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1650428684.521793}

My point is if you want to play Elden for its primal purpose of defeating the end boss aka finish the story, it is an intense game with hard bosses. There is a reason why so many people quit the game and even Gura here at the end doesn't sound like she just played a 'casual' game.

Let's compare Elden Ring to Street Fighter V.\n\nYou can play both games casually and have a blast; however, I would argue that if you want to get to the end of Elden Ring, you don't have to practice for months and learn the frame data of each of your attacks. SFV requires you to know the frame data of your character and how it stacks against a variety of other characters. Additionally, if you aren't practicing, you'll never reach the \"end\", which we can say is like top 10% of the rankings. THAT is competitive.\n\nElden Ring isn't easy by any stretch of the imagination (Margit kicked my ass back and forth for a solid 5 hours (not consecutive)), but it doesn't require an incredible amount of time-investment like competitive games to get good. Even playing casually you'll improve and get to the final boss.\n\nBut again: In the words of Marie Kondo, if Elden Ring doesn't spark joy, get rid of it.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "@saikanji9570", "channel": "UCF5N2ROksMa-EGvOQl5CIig", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nCmWB1b4BPsmon1sxNO6eYZcDeSzunmqGdpoN61M8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1650428686.743258}
