There was a difference of about 5 seconds between the DM telling Tiara that she was fine from the previous stab and her committing to the rest of the stabs. Nothing else was said by anyone in between. There was nothing that could have possibly signified any change in perspective. Calli just confirmed that the Tiara that Kiara was in control of took no damage. So of course Kiara would assume that she would still be in control of the Tiara that wasn't stabbed in the leg. The rest of the session was fun to watch but this arbitrary perspective change really cheapened the mirror scene.

They're dangerous.\"\n- Convinced two very angry and bleeding from bullet wound dogs to eat a mushroom that drugged them into returning home.\n\n• Session 3: Hunters Party Hard\n- Found a bus token for a free bus ride at a bus stop.
