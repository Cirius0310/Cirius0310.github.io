{"cid": "UgzIKQXTHDB1vS2ItoF4AaABAg", "text": "As for the nature of these experiments, they typically dealt with destroying a person's past, their identity, memories, free-will, and so on. They wanted to turn people into Manchurian Candidate-type sleeper agents, who would sleepwalk through life with no memory of their \"training,\" until the government felt they were needed, whereupon their handlers would utter a trigger phrase (much like Bioshock's infamous \"Would You Kindly\" bit), causing them to murder people in a hypnotic fugue state, without hesitation or complaint, and after waking up from it, no memory of what they had done or who had put them up to it (creating 'Plausible Deniability\" that wouldn't be tied back to any of America's armed forces or intelligence agencies, forcing the unfortunate sleeper agent to take the fall for what their government made them do unwittingly).\r\nThus, MK ULTRA went from the original goal of \"Keeping America Safe from Communism\" to becoming the terrifying realization of George Orwell's novel 1984 , where people lived in an oppressive, paranoid, anxiety-fueled state, where Big Brother is always watching your every move, action, and word like a hawk, siccing their \"Brain Police\" censors and gestapo upon those guilty of \"Thought Crime,\" of harboring thoughts and opinions that ran contrary to what the state wanted you to believe, at which point you would be sent to a 'Reeducation Facility' to be conditioned through physical and psychological torture to never question or go against the government ever again.\r\n\r\nThey would force-feed LSD and other psychoactive drugs to test subjects to turn them into pharmacological zombies too zoned out to engage in any form of autonomy. They would deprive people of sleep for days, weeks on end to make them more open to hypnotherapy, shocking them with electrified Control Collars or injecting them with epinephrine (a.k.a., \"Adrenaline\") in case they looked as though they had fallen asleep. They would selectively mutilate sections of a person's brain, their frontal lobes, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampi, putting chips in their head to monitor their brain functions and make it harder for them to resist the conditioning. They would subject the unfortunate sonuvabitch to fates worse than death OR hell, using pseudoscience and punishments cooked up by the worst and most sadistic minds of the Nazi concentration camps or CIA spooks, that would make even the Devil wince in sympathy for the victim of the CIA's experimentation.\r\n\r\nFor 20 years, 20 long, LONG years, the CIA would do this to thousands, millions of unfortunate detainees, until two things occurred. \r\nThe first was the retirement of Sidney Gottlieb in 1972, the chemist and spymaster in charge of the whole ghoulish program, who concluded, \"We have learned nothing of value from these trials, have gained no viable, practical benefit from our ceaseless testing; instead, all we have on our hands are an entire generation of broken men, mental invalids and junkies, too damaged to serve in either a combat or counter-espionage capacity. The entire thing has been a complete failure and a massive waste of taxpayer money; therefore, I see no reason why we should continue this farce.\"\r\nThe second, and arguably more important, event was the Watergate Scandal of 1973, where Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents and intrepid reporters from the New York Times scoured the office buildings and government installations for any classified intel that could be used in the congressional proceedings in Washington D.C. to impeach then President, Richard M. Nixon on charges of corruption. \r\nThis caused the CIA to throw the mother of all shitfits, immediately issuing the order to all available to put all incriminating documents though a dedicated team of paper shredders, then to take the strips of paper and chuck them into a furnace, so as to thoroughly eradicate all knowledge of the CIA's involvement in several human rights violations, shady backroom deals with organized crime groups and dubious corporations (such as Murkoff) to secure funding for their black projects, and the proxy wars they had fought in other countries against Soviet forces, without either the approval or oversight of Congress and Legislation, meaning they had illegally invaded  several neutral countries to keep them from falling into Communist hands.\r\nIn the Late '90's and early 2000's, somehow, a cache of surviving files, film footage, and experiment logs were unearthed and made public knowledge, which elicited a major shitstorm against the US government, forcing them to try and spin doctor and understate the severity of the accusations levied at them, meanwhile prosecuting several elderly menand women who thought they had put their past behind them, buried the memory of the atrocities they had orchestrated nearly a decade ago, as well as trying to pay off large groups of people who had suffered in the past and whom nobody had believed the audacious tales of government experimentation and torture, causing those not in the know to label them as delusional whackjobs and conspiracy theorist cranks, even though they had spoken the truth.\r\nWe may never fully know what caused these documents to surface after so long. Some say that in their panicked rush to put a torch to EVERYTHING, the CIA had overlooked some cardboard boxes containing excess files; others that some of the individuals responsible for overseeing the trials, the security guards and scientists, developed a conscience at some point and wanted to ensure that nothing would be swept under the rug and covered-up, so they ferreted away some of the compiled data and files and hid them until they felt safe enough to release the controversial material for the world to witness. \r\nBut whatever happened, it kept the memory of all those who suffered under the government's mad experiments from being completely erased. And unveiled the iniquities and injustices of the past. The inhumanities that man has committed unto their fellow man in the supposed defense of 'National Interests' and 'Freedom.'", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "@nerdiboy5128", "channel": "UCEdY93jTBp-abnMa1MtxAjw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kmPFrjxeRMLrzoYwSBY4GgjSWHMPNoRD1LpIfTA7k=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1681963250.848637}
