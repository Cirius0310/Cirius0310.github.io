It's still a personal thing though, and the bottom line is that this isn't about you or the people that agree with you, but the talent. I know that you think the thing you value is super important and everyone should follow it because all these other people do, but that's an ad populum argument. I didn't come here caring what other random people thought, I did caring about how the talent is, and if I vibe with them then I support them and if I don't then I go elsewhere. That's why it's important for me that other people don't interfere with their will, otherwise how can I know what I'm supporting?\nYou do realize that arguing with me is meaningless? I'm just supporting Gura's will because I happen to align with it, that's what you're challenging, not me. That's what you people have been doing for a while now, trying to still call it \"criticism\". It's not criticism, at this point you're trying to force those needs/wants on the talent. All I'm saying is that you don't have the right to do such a thing, and that the will of the talent should always, not just in this case but in all others, be absolute if we are to value creative freedom, and that there will always be people that align with it and support it, and people that don't.

They nitpick and criticize every move the streamer makes, as if they have any right to dictate how they should spend their time. Despite the fact that there are countless other streamers to watch, these individuals stubbornly cling to their \"ride or die\" mentality. They willingly subject themselves to constant disappointment, all because they can't handle the slightest deviation from their unrealistic expectations. If the streamer doesn't meet their standards, they should have the common sense to find someone else who does. But no, they choose to wallow in their own misery and drag others down with them.

I know that she wasn't the biggest fan of tweeting stuff and all that, but she's never been this radio silent ever until recently. Also, Cover/management not saying anything about the matter tells me that this is more than a health issue type of problem, unless she specifically told them not to announce anything, but I doubt that. I do commend the chumbuds that can keep being optimistic despite all this, but without any information, we're just stuck with a bunch of speculations.

I can imagine that because I'm introverted too and have this urge to just run away from things when I'm too stressed. I manage, but everyone's different.\n\nIt may seem easy to just tweet something about the situation and at times I feel disappointed too even if I just discovered her recently. But honestly I just start to think it's just avoidant behavior, she may want to run away from it all, at least for a while, while not wanting to admit that she's running. It'd fit well with how she does promise things and wants to communicate more but she just can't seem to be able to deliver. \n\nPhysical health is probably a factor but not the whole picture since she can collab just fine. They probably just coaxed her into doing those, if you are not the sole entertainer of the stream it's obviously much less stressful. Remember her self deprecating tweet? \"Guess who remembered she's a streamer\" She may be hating herself right now for not bringing herself to stream, which makes things worse of course. Imposter syndrome possibly. Which I have too, all the time.\n\nGo rewatch the first vod of the anniversary myth relay. She seemed sedated to me, so she may have taken something to deal with the stress of not being able to skip something so important as an anniversary.\n\nI'm not saying she 100% is not a lazy bum who just realized she can rake in the money with little effort, I have no scrying ball. But I still think this is probably not the case. I'm very glad that everywhere else she still receives positive feedback from her fans, it's only here that's problematic, so I felt I had to say something again on the matter.\n\nKeep giving her the benefit of the doubt I say, she'll be back hopefully. Being nasty to her won't achieve a damn thing anyway. And being nasty to your fellow chumbuds won't either. I know this sucks, I hate it too, she just may not help running away from it all right now.

Everyone is stirring up drama against Gura, but I'm not allowed to call it out? I don't think you even know what that means. Saying that I see people being emotionally immature and angry is not \"stirring up drama.\" You see angry people online elsewhere, and you look down on it, right? Are you stirring up drama if you were to mention those cases? üòÖ\n\nAnyway, since I'm not here to stir up drama, I'm severely uninterested in having a juvenile, biased debate with you over this topic. I said what I had to say, and you have already positioned yourself as someone who is prepared to refute everything I say without being willing to listen or discuss common ground. So there is zero point to further discussion. I'm not someone who finds value at shouting back and forth pointlessly with people online. The only purpose of argument/debate is to attempt to see common ground, or change minds in rare scenarios. That can't happen here, so I'm not gonna bite on your offer for a pointless spat.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "@Walrus101", "channel": "UCHQNZphbARmjvMi2e4u_dhA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/RS3ibZ4Rpz_ssvUTWlVzLdTPjMNPZs2mXTn_6sLHiEdiC-ph7ItOcOI9wrQtlHC3u8d3x1h4=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1713584597.205035}

Most people understand that personal issues can come up and the streamer should prioritize their well being first and foremost. But Gura has been absent for over a month now and hasn't even done the courtesy of giving an update, and I think it's justified for chumbuds to be upset about that (especially if they're paying for a membership). Collabs are nice, but people are subscribed to Gura's channel to watch her content.

It's just not really a big deal to me like it seems to be for others. Mostly because I'm subscribed to multiple other channels that have similarly long and inconsistent upload schedules. While I understand the frustration at the lack of communication, most people are going about voicing that frustration in a way that I don't sympathize with. \n\nTo me, it's as simple as this. If members don't like her lack of uploads and communication, they should cancel their membership until Gura gets back to an upload schedule that's acceptable to them. For those that aren't members, unsubscribe if you feel the need. Otherwise, find other content on YouTube to enjoy until Gura streams again.\n\nWhat they shouldn't do and what's all too common for people in the comments is people just sitting around complaining nonstop. If they're upset that there's no content, there's always the collab streams I mentioned in my original comment, which was my intention with that post, but otherwise, complaining feels pointless. Neither Gura or anyone else from Hololive are looking at the comments section of these videos, so many people are just screaming into the void, all while still supporting her with views, subscriptions, merch, and memberships.\n\nIf they're upset, then they should show that frustration in a way that will make a difference. Hololive are far more likely to respond to their largest vtuber's subscriber count, merch sales, and memberships dropping than they are with a bunch of upset comments. I have no problem with fans showing their disapproval of the lack of communication from Gura and Hololive by hurting them financially, but I have no sympathy for people who still choose to support them financially while constantly complaining in the comments section about them.\n\nAs for my other replies, I'm responding the way I am just because it's clear that they're anti's who are looking for attention and to fish for a negative reaction. Being positive and dismissive feels like the best way to respond imo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "@j3omega", "channel": "UCdPYgKlMJOQeu-IFieQID9w", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nUB2QN9ucqhoUmK6r1D9sRlyVXegGWF6XfmKDUoOePZg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1713584605.22666}

I am not a Gura fan in the strict sense, but I think I can understand the situation. \n\nThe lecturing here over people being incels or being beggars is already stupid and pointless. Nobody says it all to add something meaningful to the whole discussion.\n\nRegarding Gura's situation, it's true, the lack of streams and content certainly is something that can't be overlooked. Fans might be worrying about everything with her, leading to unnecessary speculation like mental health, getting tired of the fans, laziness. It would be at least fair within the reasonable framework that Gura addressed the situation properly about the streams. It's not that fans are entitled to that. It's just if she isn't enjoying the job, something she did on her own will, and at least if she isn't enjoying it, it would be reasonable to leave, graduate or else. She is not forced to compel, after all.\n\nIf she is currently busy, this complicates the situation, because VTubing implies a bit of dedication to what you're doing. Of course, I don't think people need to be compelled in all regards, but I think solving the situation is more important.\n\nI am saying it for the sake of everyone. VTubing is for people to have fun, both the entertainers and the audience. That harmony builds the base for a healthier community.\n\nI just hope you're doing well, Gura, if you read this.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "@WarmMilkAlu", "channel": "UCB9303xxsLyyZdr1wBDXIgQ", "votes": "22", "replies": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/sc7xScEuh4508ITYohqRkCaVriA1ThOqXUGxlCtKH92wYEzOazpF6u0p4NwAOr0Riplip_Kk=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1713584622.939941}

Another thing I want to ask is why would someone with a virtual uwu character who doesn't know you and perhaps doesn't even care about you make your day better? I know that we all have ups and downs, it's part of life. However, why should your mood depend on pixels on a computer screen? It shouldn't, because if you spent your time in a more meaningful way you would be able to more or less control your emotions and mood, thus making you a more accomplished and successful individual. \n\nAgain, I am writing all of this as someone who has been in the same position as you are in.
