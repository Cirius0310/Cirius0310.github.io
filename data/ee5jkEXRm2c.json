{"cid": "UgzhYz3zQh8UaIVziGx4AaABAg", "text": "If you are thinking of doing more of this as a series, I might have a few suggestions that could help make it more streamlined since it seems like you had more you wanted to do than what was shown.  If you want to try to fit it within a certain time, maybe switching to a points system could help.  That way you can set how many questions per section before someone is eliminated and where to put commercial breaks in.  Just an example if 6 is the number of contestants : First round 10 questions (at 100 pt for correct answers and maybe a small break after the 5th question mark to assess who is in the lead or in danger of being eliminated), 1 contestant is eliminated, maybe a commercial break, 8 questions (at 200pt for correct answers and maybe a small break after the 4th question mark to assess who is in the lead or in danger of being eliminated), 1 contestant is eliminated, maybe a commercial break, 6 questions (at 300~400pt for correct answers), double elimination leaving 2 for a head-to-head with final 5 questions.  Maybe have questions that have multiple answers to them in this section so the contestants can get possibly more points each round to possibly get a lead.  500~1,000pt for possible correct answers.  1 winner at the end of it all.  Possible reward for winner or batsu for the losers.  Both can work as well.  You can adjust the number of point value or number of questions to however you want to be longer or shorter than what I've suggested.   I hope this is helpful for you.\n\nMost of the modifiers can be the same.  The only one that would be changed is strike swap.  Since contestants will be eliminated at set intervals instead of calculating whose x is switched or removed, that should be changed to something else.  I have some suggestions and you could add more modifiers if you want.  Suggestion 1: Modifier doubles the points for correct answers of that round for that one question.  Suggestion 2: You get partial points from others guessing correctly if you can't get it right.  Maybe a half of the points of all the correct answers in that question round.  Suggestion 3: Getting a correct answer gives negative points for those who don't get it correct.  Same as the points you'd get correct for that question round but on the negative scale.  Suggestion 4:  Taking a comprehension test to get an extra 250~500 pts.  Maybe smaller for the earlier rounds but bigger for the later rounds.  Suggestion 5: change the subject of the question to something else.  This one might be hard since this means having a stack of questions beforehand.  My earlier suggestion above would amount to 29 questions total (lower if you want the stream shorter) + 6 possible chances for a subject change.   If the amount of subject categories is 5 with 6 questions each to fill the question quota each can possibly answer, then you will need 6 backup questions for each subject for the change.  That means you'd have to have about double the questions of the amount of questions you expect to be answered at minimum for one stream +6 just in case.  More subjects would increase that amount.  More work but you can save those questions for the next game if you plan to have more episodes after and all you have to do is just fill in the subjects missing questions that have already been answered so it's less work for the later episodes in the long run.    I think this will help you greatly if you plan to do future Big Brain Game episodes run more smoothly.    You could also a co-host to bounce off of if you are unsure if the answers the contestant say are correct or not or just generally for banter instead of relying on you alone.   One more suggestion I'd say that you can do is have less trick question questions because people catch on to it quickly if there is too many.  Hope you read this to help you make a better and much efficient Big Brain Games in the future.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "@EyeOfLanteveldt", "channel": "UCN2QSekrDm0EmJU207M-0aA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ThKTSzTH4XDFbfKMe-RIHhYj0SldNCnyq03eWcR4JyWGckfQccNIUOTtivjwo_SVUs5OYo4D=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1681963735.852604}

It was only in about 2013 that we actually discovered which of these smaller waterways was the \"actual source\" of the Amazon river; a small creek flowing in the Andes called Apacheta Creek. By determining that this was the real source of the Amazon, we realized that the Amazon was actually about 350 miles longer than previously recorded, just barely edging it out over the Nile.\n\nBasically, if any of them were drawing on school knowledge from pre-2013, then they couldn't have known.

If the answer is wrong they get an X. If they answer correctly the modifier user gets an X\n-The hallway joker             : Choose an already eliminated student to also give an answer to the question for you. If they are correct and you are wrong they will protect you from getting an X (this includes already eliminated students more in the stream later on)\n-The exchange student    :Choose one player to answer in a different language ( they can choose any language except for english)\n-The teacher is a spy!      : After answering a question wrong the student can use this modifier and Gura-sensei has to give them 2 answers to the question (the correct answer and a made up one). They have to choose one answer. If they choose the correct one they get spared of an X\n-The reverse card             : The choosen student gets muted until gura-sensei revealed the answer. Instead of answering the question the student has to come up with what was the actual question (this obviously doesnt work with math questions and maybe should only be used on geography or science question like in the stream: The answer was \"San Andreas fault\" and the student has to come up with the question \"what is the name of the fault in california\" or smth similar)\n-Grant me your wisdom   :The student can call in to the current big brain champion (currently the kronstar to answer for them)\n-I hate group work!           : The students get split in 2 groups and have to solve a question, riddle or any other task as a group\n-The last stand                  : Upon revieving the 3rd X the player enters last stand mode and stays in the game for 3 more questions. If they answer one question wrong they will be eliminated but if they manage to anwer the 3 question correct and the other players all together get an total of 3 X's with those 3 questions they get cleared of 1 X\n-Teacher is a dum dum    : Every player prepares one question before they start the lesson. They can clear themselves of 1 X by asking gura-sensei to answer that question. If gura's answer is wrong they get cleared of 1 X\n-(Ebi)Swarm intelligence  : Ask chat in a poll for the answer\n-The eager beaver             : After using this modifier and answering 3 questions correct gura-sensei will give the eager beaver an extra hard question.

{"cid": "UgwJ20JVBswjlGEbilB4AaABAg", "text": "Concerning the rules, the \"strike swap\" mechanic needs more consideration it seems like. It never came up, but imagine this. A person with one strike (Member A) is targeted for a swap by another person (Member B). If A gets the question wrong and B gets it right, this would take A from 1 strike to kicked out of the game. That seems super unfair and unfun. Or what about if A had two strikes and then got the question right, but so did B? Then A would lose the game on a question they got right.\n\nMy suggestions for what to do about this:\n-Delete strike swap and replace it with strike removal. A one time chance to simply remove your own strike, without giving it to anyone else.\n-Delete strike swap and replace with \"bonus removal\". Getting the question right lets you delete someone else's powerup that they haven't used up till now. If this seems OP, maybe if you use bonus removal and get the question wrong, you lose one of your own remaining bonuses. Under this rule, you aren't allowed to use bonus removal if you don't have a bonus to lose.\n-Gura's suggestion to where strike swap can only add a first or second strike, but it can never be the third one.

Platypuses are blue!\" (Holup, Ollie, excusemimasen. What universe am I in again?)\nThat moment was amazing lol\nVery good show, Gura and students! Seemed to pretty much go off without a hitch from the viewing end! Very glad we could have this back so soon:_BlueLight::_WuvXob::_RedLight:\n\nIf you're interested in feedback:\n\n- Seems like you weren't into the way the \"X Swap\" worked and trying to fix it was adding extra rules that were getting complicated. My suggestion: Change it and keep it simple. Like \"Copy Homework: If any other contestant gets the question right, you will not get an X even if you are wrong\". It's similar in that it can remove/prevent an X, but it doesn't get complicated with targeting rules and other preconditions.\n\n- The ads are great! Hope we can get more in the future with new episodes. I also know other members have made fake ads before as well. Could these all be shared as pooled resources? It would make for some funny lore continuity.\n\n- Automate! Keep looking for ways to simplify the gameshow setup so it's easier to do things like notate used abilities and cycle questions. That will lessen the stress and let you unwind just a bit more when trying to wrangle 6 other people lol\n\n-Speaking of other people, I definitely think those who are out should still be around in some sense and have interaction with the audience. Ideally that might be something like a backstage camera where they could comment on the action, but that would necessitate a separate stream. Instead of that, maybe they could have a \"Hail Mary\" chance to get back in the game if someone else fails a comprehension test but they answer it correctly? Similar to some Jackbox games as a way to keep everyone engaged. Granted, here you are primarily engaging the audience, but it could still spice things up. Maybe they could be allowed to keep drawing and goofing off in the background (while muted) while the other contestants are still going? Not that true eliminations are bad either. Makes it more dramatic lol\n\nI hope we get more, but don't stress yourself out!!!

As many said maybe change the elimination format to a who has more right/less wrong. You can still have the option of removing 1 x b\nVia comprehension test cause those were brilliant.

I kinda get WHY you privated the failed attempt but can I ask to reconsider and keep it up as a \"test drive\" or \"rehearsal\" episode?
