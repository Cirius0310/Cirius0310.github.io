Everything you're talking about regarding the human spirit is a metaphysical quality, but the post-humans have physical limitations. How does Carl 'reject' being fused to an assembly line?\n;\nIf it were a situation where PATHOS was just left alone, they would probably have been fine. They had an organizational structure which could have evolved into a government, they had a large enough population to maintain genetic diversity, they had a stable geothermal power source, could maintain their habitat via structure gel, and the undersea ecosystems were still running, so they had fish to eat. In that situation they could have gone on and produced a society and all the things you talk about, and eventually their descendants would have repopulated the surface.\n;\nBut the problem is they weren't left alone, they had to contend with the WAU.

At no point is there a chance that the paper you're copying will somehow magically turn into the copy. They become separate entities the moment that the copying process is completed and their experiences start to diverge. That's why Simon and Catherine were never getting on the ARK. They were getting a version of themselves onto the ARK, but they were always going to remain behind no matter what. Simon just failed to realize that. Though to his credit, he did suffer from literal physical brain damage following a car crash, so i think we can cut him some slack. I guess Catherine was a bit slimy to keep stringing him along even after noticing that he wasn't catching on, but in her defense telling him the truth migh have meant that he would refuse to help her get the ARK into space, so i personally think she was at least partially justified.

The \"chance\" comes not from a possibility of the original somehow becoming the copy on the ARK, but from the somewhat abstract question of \"Why am I me?\". The Simon on the Ark is \"lucky\" to be the one of the two experiencing the Ark. It just gets weird because both results of the coin flip occur, and the only thing differentiating the two Simons is their respective result.\n\nBut I think its validity is dependent upon one's feelings about the question \"Is a perfect copy of you still you?\". If you somehow learned that every time you went to sleep and woke up that the consciousness that woke up was a copy of the one that went to sleep, would you still carry on as normal or lament the fact that you are going to die at the end of the day? \n\nIf a person who feels that the copy is a continuation of the original rather than being a totally separate entity were in Simon's situation and wanted to get onto the ARK, the coin flip model makes sense.

I think some people were also always saying don't trust Catherine etc but nothing happened. So let me summarise the game. Of course spoilers.\n\nSo humanity is stuck in a post apocalyptic world because of a meteor that struck the earth and brought along some mutated virus. Humanity built a machine called WAU to store human minds and that virus took over WAU and started corrupting robots by creating consciousness inside them. Due to this humanity built the ARC to store all the human minds and launch it into space so they can escape the virus WAU and do something about it I guess? So this is also what was happening when Simon got his brain scanned first. Hence the body of Simon died and his mind woke up 100 years later into the robot body in the whole WAU apocalypse. So Simon in the end stopped the WAU and launched the arc so he essentially saved the planet and entire humanity. Summary over.\n\nThe concept is cool but there's honestly nothing sweet about it. Like humanity cannot do anything if they're stuck inside a virtual world. The Simon in the real world is obviously dead while Simon 4.0 in the virtual world is unable to progress and will live on forever, his only meaning of life being to stimulate his brain with chemicals. I guess all the monsters chasing us were humans who were transferred into the ARC and the WAU consumed them. Well it's a decent story I guess but no impact for me.

Can't blame you though since Gura did miss a lot of important lore stuff.\n\nOk what happened is the WAU already existed before the comet's impact, and its main function was to control the life support systems of the base. After the comet hit and wiped out all life on the surface, the WAU changed its directives from maintaining the base to \"preserving humanity\". There was no virus or anything involved. \n\nBut since the WAU is a machine which doesn't have a clear definition of what humanity actually is, it starts doing all kinds of crazy things in order to  follow its warped directive of \"preserving humanity\", like scanning people's minds and stuffing them into robots, reanimating dead human bodies, keeping people alive on invasive life support, or putting people in a Matrix-like dreamstate while their body is left comatose.\n\n\nThe ARK project was initially a pet project by Catherine, but after the comet hit the survivors thought it was the best way of ensuring that at least some remnant of humanity can survive. Interestingly enough. Catherine actually reversed-engineered some of the WAU's innovations to develop the ARK technology, but otherwise the ARK has nothing to do with the WAU. The reason why they wanted to get the ARK away from the WAU is because they didn't want the WAU to corrupt the brain scans inside. The ARK was never meant to stop the WAU or anything.\n\nWhen Simon got his brain scanned first in the prologue, it was nearly 100 years before the main story. The reason Simon shows up on the base in a robot body is because original Simon from 100 years ago let his brain scan be saved and people started using his legacy scan as an extremely common and available foundation for AI development. And since his brain scans were so easily available, the WAU had no trouble accessing it and transferring his brain scan into a robot as part of its \"preserve humanity\" directive. \n\nAs the player, Simon later finds out that he was not magically teleported into the future, but rather his memories and experiences were copied into a robot and that his original self died nearly a century ago. In any case, Simon launches the ARK into space, but it is a bittersweet ending because for all of Simon's efforts, it doesn't change the fact that humanity is still extinct.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "@emilchan5379", "channel": "UCafgCTZJOZBfGoF5TAd9dPw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kbWXit6A7KG15nbMPT5ql90-kxMb7vuu2GGSIhIgNQpGk=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1618898837.829229}

That is some extremely high level processing power I must say. But if WAU is a machine then what is the heart thing Simon had to stick his hand into to neutralise it? That can't be part of the machine since it's a heart. And I guess launching the ARK info space is a way to preserve humanity's legacy but it's not going to help bring anything back for sure.

Soma doesn't say that a \"soul\" can be capture as data, because according to what Soma presents, there's no such thing as a \"soul\". A person's consciousness is entirely composed of their past experiences and the way their brain is wired. So when your brained is scanned and copied, it creates a second person with its own separate consciousness. I recommend watching Kurzgetsatz's video if you want a better explanation.\n\nI haven't played KH2, but I assume it would mean that someone's consciousness isn't just their brain and how it functions, but has something extra (a \"soul\"), so just copying the brain wouldn't be able to make a new person (or something along thoses lines, idk I haven't played the game and only basing myself on that one line you said)\n\n\nWe currently don't have a definitive answer as far as I know, so it's mostly a matter of belief for now.

In reality the original is never going to get transferred, while the copy will always end up transferring. In other words, there is no coin toss since everything is already pre-determined.\n\nSince the copy inherits all the memories and thoughts of the original, one could say that prior to the coin toss, Simon 3 and Simon 4 are basically the same entity. And Simon 3 and Simon 4 have no way of knowing which Simon they are until they actually perform the coin toss. From Simon 4's perspective, he won the toss while from Simon 3's perspective, he lost. From their perspective it looks like there was a coin toss when in actuality there was none. The coin toss is just them finding out who is the per-determined winner or loser.\n\nHence why Simon 3 will always fail to get onto the ARK while Simon 4 will always succeed. \n\nTL;DR: There is no coin toss, just the perception of one, because a true coin toss implies chance but there is no chance involved when transferring.

So it was only a very delayed death sentence...\n\nOn further notes, copying and pasting works the same way as cut and paste, or move, you pick the original data copy it and paste it, the difference with the latter 2 is that there's an extra, automatic deletion step, so it gives the illusion of the data being moved, but it wasn't... So you don't need to feel bad about the \"moral\" choices on the game, aside from the last one that was actually mercy, since she would've died anyway...\n\nAnd now, probably consciousness \"data\" wouldn't probably work that way, since the way it works kinda makes it impossible to copy, maybe it'll need to be transferred, but literally transferred, not like normal bit data of 0's and 1's, so the premise it's a bit crooked, so don't feel so bad gura~ lol", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "@lXlDarKSuoLlXl", "channel": "UCJIeIFXIrTfF7gGNWxb_tlw", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_k3-HcciyRjgKtIRIFl2T9E0wjYX60FPTkQcJyw78M=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1618898845.689692}
