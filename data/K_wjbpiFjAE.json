{"cid": "UgytdBMe27-rqqW45Lh4AaABAg", "text": "This is the very first Zombie film ever made so the term \"Zombie\" didn't exist yet till about 12 years later when they started making more \"zombie\" films!!!! Not knowing what a zombie even was back then is a 1000x more terrifying than actually knowing what one is today!!!!!! Its easy to think about how u think u would actually handle a situation like this today knowing everything about zombies but just imagine if u didn't even know wtf a zombie was like the characters in this movie!!!!! Everyone has a plan & thinks they know wtf they would do while watching a movie on your couch thinking u would do this or that if u were in this type of situation until it actually happens for real & then all of a sudden , u find out how serious & hard & impossibly dangerous it actually would really be in real life!!!! \n\nNothing is ever as easy as it seems & there will definitely not be a bunch of ppl acting like heros in real life , most ppl would be in shock just like Barbara in real life & wouldn't know wtf to actually do in a situation this terrifying!!!!! Ppl act like they will just grab a gun or baseball bat & shoot their way through a entire horde of flesh eating corpses but you're all idiots if u think that would actually work in real life üòÇüòÇüòÇ this movie isn't a made up super hero fantasy like all the so called badasses like in The Walking Dead & every modern day zombie movie were they kill tons of zombies like its nothing!!!! In real life it would most likely turn into a extremly impossible terrifying situation like it is in this movie!!!! That's why this is considered the only realistic & logical Zombie film to this very day because in real actual life , we would all most likely die as quickly as all the ppl die in this movie even today with knowing what a zombie actually is , it won't make much of a difference regardless!!!! Trust meüòÇüòÇüòÇ most ppl will naturally panic in this type of situation no matter what they try to say they would do if it was actually them in that situation , ppl only talk like that from the comfort of their house while texting about it on their phones!!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nEven all the so called experienced gun experts & martial artists , they literally only need one single zombie bite from sneaking up on u silently while u are occupied with  another zombie or even a tiny scratch from a fingernail that breaks thru the skin & its literally all over with for u üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "@MLawrence-z9k", "channel": "UCz-mcjsSdUn7Gb06U8sBkrA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kAvXwKhF9W-758960a9XjLrXxvSdrZkX4XZl0vZ0CotMcCwuJe0HKveyMX8NMWQ9UFfw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1726804856.01273}
